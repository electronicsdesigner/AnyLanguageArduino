#Arduino Command Line Interface
Arduino compiler for Windows.

You are reading through the source code for a project called 
AnyLanguageArduino. It seems reasonable to assume that you
know what Arduino is.

The following files for the Arduino CLI utility were downloaded from
the Arduino CLI installation page 
[https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.20/installation/].

A GitHub repository for the project [https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli]
provides access to the source code. It is licenced under the GPL-3.0
License. The source code of AnyLanguageArduino is publically available
and may be modified and distributed freely on condition that licencing and
authorship notices are retained.

Ideally, the dependency of Arduino-CLI on the AnyLanguageArduino should
be managed in a better way (than just including a copy of the compiled
code in a GitHub subfolder). Proper management of dependencies has
been left as a future feature.
