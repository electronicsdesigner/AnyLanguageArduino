#Juniper Compiler
Juniper programming language cross-compiler for windows.

Juniper is a functional reactive programming language being
developed by Caleb Helbling (Purdue University). Louis Ades 
(Tufts University) was a former developer.

The following files for the Juniper programming language 
[https://www.juniper-lang.org/] were taken from the local 
"C:\\Program Files\Juniper" directory after running the 
installer for windows [https://www.juniper-lang.org/install.html].

A GitHub repository for the project [https://github.com/calebh/Juniper]
provides access to the source code. It is licenced under the MIT
License, which permits distribution under the condition that 
license and copyright notices are retained.

Ideally, the dependency of Juniper on the AnyLanguageArduino should
be managed in a better way (than just including a copy of the compiled
code in a GitHub subfolder). Proper management of dependencies has
been left as a future feature.
